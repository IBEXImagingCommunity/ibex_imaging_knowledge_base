<!-- Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from the contrib.md.in, reagent_data_dict.csv and reagent_glossary.csv files. -->

&#x26A0; **NOTE**  
By contributing to the knowledge-base you are agreeing that the provided data be made available under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and that you will abide by the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.html).

<span style="color:purple;">The knowledge-base was made possible by researchers like you, see [who they are](the_who.md) and our thoughts on overcoming the fear of sharing.</span>

To contribute your knowledge you need the following:
1. Open Researcher and Contributor ID ([ORCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORCID)), your unique scientific identifier. If you do not have an ORCID, register for it [here](https://orcid.org/register).
1. A GitHub account. If you do not have an account, follow these [instructions to sign up for one](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).


This knowledge-base follows the standard GitHub
[fork and pull request, triangular workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).


## One time setup
1. If you are comfortable working with git and GitHub from the command-line, install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Otherwise, download the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application and [read the installation and configuration help](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop).
1. Fork the [IBEX Imaging Community repository](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base) and clone it to a local directory ([GitHub Desktop instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)).
1. If you are adding reagent information (including reproducing results of existing configurations), contributing a protocol or sharing a new video tutorial, add your information to the "creators" section in the .zenodo.json file (This is a hidden file. To see it on windows, open file-explorer and select View->Show->Hidden items).
**Note**: Additions should maintain alphabetical order based on last name and be inserted between the first and last two entries (these three entries remain in their fixed locations in the list).

## Adding information to the knowledge-base

### Before starting
Create a new local git branch based off the `main` branch ([GitHub Desktop instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches#creating-a-branch)).

### Modifying the *publications.bib* file:
Simply add an entry to the file using the appropriate [bibtex entry type](https://www.bibtex.com/e/entry-types/).

To give credit where credit is due, we ask that you provide the complete list of authors and do not truncate it, even if it is long.

### Modifying a markdown file in the *docs* directory:
Simply edit the relevant file.

Some markdown files are automatically generated (e.g. index.md, reagent_resources.md), do not edit these files. At the top of auto-generated files you will find a line reading: "Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from...", edit those source files.

### Modifying *protocols.csv*:

Add your protocol details to this csv file, title, URL which links to the protocol and the protocol details (a short abstract describing it). Do not use non-ASCII characters in the title or description. Represent them using standard ASCII, instead of &alpha; write alpha.

### Modifying *videos.csv*:

Add your video details to this csv file, title, URL which links to the video, the video details (a short abstract describing it) and the date. We use separate columns for year, month, day so that we do not need to remember an order, mm/dd/yy or dd/mm/yy and tools like MS Excel will not modify entries in an attempt to help us.

### Modifying *reagent_resources.csv*:

Do not use non-ASCII characters such as &trade; or &alpha; (either remove or represent using standard ASCII "alpha"). For explanation of the column contents see the [reagent metadata section](#reagent-metadata).

**Note**: If using excel or google docs to edit the file, you need to be careful if your preferences include automatic data conversion, as this may change the file content incorrectly. In our case, a conjugate such as 9E10 will be converted to a number, 90000000000. In excel, disable the "Automatic Data Conversion" before opening the file. In google docs open an empty spreadsheet and then **import** the csv file. During the import processes you will first select the delimiter, comma in our case. You will then need to specify the column type as "text" for all columns.

#### Adding new line:
1. Add a line to the [reagent_resources.csv](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/blob/main/data/reagent_resources.csv).
2. Create corresponding supporting material sub-directory using the target_conjugate as the directory name and add a markdown file with your ORCID as the file prefix (see existing files for reference). Supporting material file has a fixed layout, see [supporting_template.md](supporting_template.md).  
**Note**: When creating the target_conjugate sub-directory you will need to replace the following characters with an underscore: space, tab, "/", "\", "{", "}", "[", "]", "(", ")", "<", ">", ":", "&". Consequently, supporting material for the target conjugate pair of "Chicken IgY (H&L)", "FITC" is found in a directory named "Chicken_IgY__H_L__FITC".
3. Optionally add *small* (<300KB) image files (jpg) and refer to them in the supporting material file. Please format your images as 72dpi, 24bit color, 1200x1200px. Write caption identifying validated reagent. Use colorblind safe colors (e.g. cyan, red; magenta, green, blue; no green and red). Include scale bar. Use zoom that allows fine details to be seen. See an example [here](./supporting_material/CD21_PE/0000-0003-4379-8967.md). Add the file information to the `image_resources.csv` file found in the data directory.

#### Adding information to existing line:
---

We only accept up to 5 ORCID additions in the `Agree` or `Disagree` columns. This means that, the original contributor's work was replicated by up to 4 people from other laboratories or refuted by up to 5 people from other laboratories.

---

1. Add your ORCID to the `Agree` or `Disagree` column on the appropriate line in the reagent_resources.csv file. Use a semicolon `;` to separate from the previous ones (e.g. `ORCID1; ORCID2; ORCID3`).
2. If after adding your vote:
  * The number of ORCIDs in the `Disagree` column is greater than those in the `Agree` column:
    1. Change the content of the `Recommend` column from "Yes" to "No" or the other way round and swap the ORCIDs between the `Agree` and `Disagree` columns.
    2. Modify all the supporting material markdown files associated with this row, changing the `ResultXXX` and `RecommendationXXX` sections.
3. Add a markdown file with your ORCID to the existing sub-directory. The easiest option is to copy the contents of one of the markdown files already in this directory and modify it.
4. Optionally add **small** image files (jpg) and refer to them in the supporting material file. Please format your images as 72dpi, 24bit color, 1200x1200px. Write caption identifying validated reagent with orthogonal marker (see below). Use colorblind safe colors (Cyan, red; magenta, green, blue; no green and red). Include scale bar. Use zoom that allows fine details to be seen.

### After work is completed
After completing the work, update the public knowledge-base. This can be done using git on the command-line or using GitHub desktop:
1. Commit the changes ([GitHub Desktop instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project)).
2. Push the commit to GitHub ([GitHub Desktop instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github)).
3. Create a pull-request on GitHub ([GitHub Desktop instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request)).
