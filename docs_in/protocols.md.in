# Protocols

<!-- Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from the protocols.md.in and protocols.csv files. -->

As part of the IBEX imaging community's commitment to excellence we strive to make research easily reproducible. We encourage the publication of detailed protocols covering all aspects of the experimental work, from hardware construction, sample preparation, imaging settings to computational analysis of the final images. Ideally, all protocols would be hosted on a single platform (e.g. [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/)).
 
While that is the ideal, in practice we know there are multiple protocol repositories and we do not want to limit your choices. This page serves as a central location, referencing protocols across the various hosting platforms.
