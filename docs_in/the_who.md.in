# The Who

<!-- Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from the .zenodo.json file. -->

Junior and senior scientists from academia, government, and industry are welcome to contribute. We celebrate unpublished work, but understand that it is not uncommon to have multiple groups working simultaneously on similar research projects. For this reason, please only contribute what you feel comfortable sharing prior to publication.

Our vision for the knowledge-base is a venue to share details that are critical for successful and reproducible work. These details are often found, if at all, in the supplemental material. Once you have published, please return to the knowledge-base to showcase your publication and report critical details related to your work. All you need to do is follow these [detailed instructions](contrib.md). Thank you!
