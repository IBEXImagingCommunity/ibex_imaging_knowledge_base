# The Who

<!-- Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from the .zenodo.json file. -->

Most scientists are competitive and view science from that perspective. In the current scientific landscape it is not uncommon to have multiple groups working simultaneously on similar research directions. Consequentially, there is a chance that if you share data your group may be overtaken by the "competition" and loose the opportunity to publish your results (a.k.a. be scooped).

We are well aware of this issue and do not ask you to contribute any knowledge you do not feel comfortable sharing prior to publication. Once you have published, we do expect you to share the knowledge making your work reproducible. This knowledge-base is the venue for you to share all the details that are critical for success and that are often found, if at all, in the supplemental material. Hopefully, we have convinced you that sharing your knowledge is the right thing to do and all you need are the [detailed instructions](contrib.md).
