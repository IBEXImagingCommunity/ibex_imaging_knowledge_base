A picture is worth a thousand words, so how much is a video worth?

As part of our commitment to excellence we encourage knowledge sharing in the form of videos. These include both general talks on multiplexed imaging and short, subject specific, tutorials. The former provide the bigger picture, the state of the field at a particular point in time. The latter provide the finer details associated with a specific task and are a way to formalize and document lab lore (undocumented common practices that are assumed to be common knowledge but are not practiced in the same manner across labs).

Videos are listed in reverse chronological order:
