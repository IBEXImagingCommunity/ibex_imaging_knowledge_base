Highly Multiplexed Imaging of Diverse Tissues Using IBEX,https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/6313499546113799179?source=FF4,"Multiplexed antibody-based imaging empowers the study of complex cellular phenotypes in situ by enabling the evaluation of dozens of protein biomarkers in a single tissue section. Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), is an antibody-based staining and chemical bleaching technique that allows comprehensive profiling (65+ parameters) in diverse tissues. It is compatible with 250+ commercially available antibodies and 16 unique fluorophores. It can be adopted by different imaging platforms at a low cost, and the experiment can be done in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. In this webinar, we will go over methods to study normal and malignant lymph nodes and topics related to multiplexed tissue imaging, namely: optimal tissue processing, working with fixed frozen and FFPE specimens, overcoming autofluorescence, identifying appropriate reagents, validating antibodies, and creating organ mapping antibody panels (OMAPs).",general,2022,10,18,0000-0003-4379-8967;0000-0003-0315-7727
Accelerating discovery together: Community resources for multiplexed imaging of diverse tissues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFaOPIOcBCE,"Multiplexed antibody-based imaging enables the characterization of cellular interactions, spatial relationships, and histological patterns in tissues. These techniques require considerable resources and domain expertise for implementation, limiting their widespread adoption. To overcome these challenges, we developed Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), an open-source method that can be completed at relatively low cost in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. In addition to cost-effective techniques such as IBEX, community initiatives are needed to extend the reach of multiplexed tissue imaging. The IBEX Imaging Community is an international group of scientists committed to sharing knowledge related to multiplexed imaging in a transparent and collaborative manner. Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs) are community-validated resources that save time and money, increase reproducibility, and support the construction of a Human Reference Atlas. This webinar will provide guidelines for the successful application of IBEX to a wide range of scientific questions using diverse imaging platforms. A significant amount of time will be devoted to the following topics: optimal tissue processing, working with fixed frozen and FFPE specimens, identifying appropriate reagents, and constructing organ atlases. Team science initiatives will be highlighted to encourage attendees to join and accelerate discovery together.",general,2023,4,20,0000-0003-4379-8967

Coating slide with chrome alum-gelatin adhesive,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksNR3gsl5rg,"<p>Coat a glass slide by adding 15 &mu;L chrome alum-gelatin to one side. Spread evenly using the edge of a cover slip or a separate glass slide via the blood smear technique. Note, it may require multiple spreading passages with the slide to ensure even coating of chrome alum-gelatin without streaks. If chrome alum-gelatin pools on the slide, aspirate excess fluid and respread as these accumulations can result in autofluorescence artifacts during image acquisition. Be mindful of stated expiration date on chrome alum-gelatin.</p><p>For best results, prepare chrome alum-gelatin coated slides freshly (i.e., the day of tissue sectioning) or no more than 7 days prior to tissue sectioning. If chrome alum-gelatin coated slides are prepared ahead of sectioning, store at room temperature (do not freeze as this will compromise the adhesive properties).</p><p>Dry coated slide in oven at 60 degrees Celsius for 1 hour.</p><p>We purchase chrome alum-gelatin from Newcomer Supply, but recipes are available online if this item does not ship to your country (e.g. <a href=""https://www.laboratorynotes.com/preparation-of-chrome-alum-containing-gelatin-solution-for-preparation-of-coated-slides-for-histological-tissue-sections/"">this recipe</a>).</p>",tutorial,2023,8,22,0009-0006-1490-3667;0000-0002-5187-810X;0000-0001-9189-7172;0000-0002-0835-911X
Mounting tissue and applying coverslip,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqHlrSmsG_8,Remove as much PBS as possible without drying out tissues. Quickly add the minimum amount of Fluoromount-G mounting medium necessary to completely cover each tissue section. Gently cover with a coverslip. We typically use 10-40 &mu;L per tissue section. Ensure there are no bubbles on or near tissue.,tutorial,2023,8,22,0009-0006-1490-3667;0000-0002-5187-810X;0000-0001-9189-7172;0000-0002-0835-911X
Coverslip removal after image acquisition,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXN19na8I6Y,"<p>After the slide (containing coverslip) has been soaked in 1X PBS pH 7.4 to allow coverslip to loosen (typically 30-60 minutes), carefully remove slide from container. Ideally coverslip will have fallen off naturally. If coverslip is loose but still attached, gently lift a corner of the coverslip with a pair of fine forceps or razor blade.</p><p>We typically wait until coverslip detaches from slide naturally or, at minimum, is moving freely on the slide under the force of gravity. Attempting to remove coverslip before it has sufficiently loosened may result in tissue deformation and/or loss.</p>",tutorial,2023,8,24,0009-0006-1490-3667;0000-0002-5187-810X;0000-0001-9189-7172;0000-0002-0835-911X
Making 1 mg/mL of LiBH<sub>4</sub>,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MH_aLEMyF8,"<p>Dissolve LiBH<sub>4</sub> (STREM Chemicals, cat no. 93-0397; purchase in 1 g aliquots) into diH<sub>2</sub>O (Quality Biological, cat no. 351-029-101) and allow to sit at RT for 10 minutes until the formation of bubbles occurs (not shown in video). Pass the solution through a 0.22 &mu;m syringe filter (Millipore Sigma, cat no. SLGSM33SS) attached to a 20 mL syringe (EXEL Int., cat no. 26280) to remove any impurities prior to use (not shown).</p><p>Always prepare LiBH<sub>4</sub> solution in a chemical fume hood with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Mixing LiBH<sub>4</sub> with diH<sub>2</sub>O will generate hydrogen gas which is highly flammable. For this reason, we always work with small amounts of LiBH<sub>4</sub> relative to the amount of water initially added. We do not mix >10 mg of LiBH<sub>4</sub> with diH<sub>2</sub>O. This amount can be quickly diluted to 1 mg/mL with volumes handled by standard serological pipets/pipet-aids. Always wrap LiBH<sub>4</sub> stock with parafilm (suggest Bemis Company Inc., cat no. S37440) and store in the presence of desiccant. We recommend replacing LiBH<sub>4</sub> every 4 weeks as repeated exposure to moisture/air has been observed to reduce fluorophore inactivation efficacy. Be sure to follow institutional guidelines for proper disposal of hazardous chemicals.</p><p>The formation of bubbles indicates the solution is ready for filtration and subsequent use. For best results, use solution immediately after filtration. We have noted effective fluorophore inactivation up to 4 hours after initial dissolution of LiBH<sub>4</sub>.</p>",tutorial,2023,8,23,0009-0006-1490-3667;0000-0002-5187-810X;0000-0001-9189-7172;0000-0002-0835-911X

Accelerating discovery together: A community approach to multiplexed tissue imaging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsoJdrszzVc,"<p>
This webinar gives a broad overview of spatial biology techniques with a special emphasis on the iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) technique, an open source method for highly multiplexed imaging (65+ parameters). In the webinar, Dr. Radtke describes two communities working to reduce the time, cost, and expertise required to adopt multiplexed antibody-based imaging approaches. The first resource is the IBEX Knowledge-Base, an open, global repository for reagents, protocols, datasets, and software related to IBEX and other spatial biology methods. Here, Dr. Radtke reviews the design, motivation, and utility of the IBEX Knowledge-Base and associated community. The second resource, led by the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), involves the publication of community-validated Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs).
