SITK-IBEX,"<p>Software for aligning/registering images acquired with the IBEX microscopy imaging technique. This Python package enables alignment of multiple cycles of fluorescence images, acquired using IBEX. A repeated marker is used to register all panels to a selected panel (in the registration nomenclature this is the fixed image). After registration all panels are resampled onto the fixed image.</p><p>While this method was developed for a specific imaging protocol, it will likely work for other  protocols that contain a repeated marker. The registration approach is implemented using the <a href=""https://www.simpleitk.org"">SimpleITK</a> toolkit registration framework.</p><p>The key implementation aspects include:</p><ol><li>Multi-phase based approach with robust initialization.</li><li>Multi-resolution and point sampling.</li><li>Affine transformation model.</li><li>Use of correlation as optimized similarity metric.</li></ol>",2020,https://pypi.org/project/sitkibex/,https://github.com/niaid/sitk-ibex,Python,Apache-2.0,10.1073/pnas.2018488117
SimpleITK Imaris extensions,"<a href=""https://www.simpleitk.org"">SimpleITK</a> based extensions for the imaris (Oxford Instruments) microscopy image analysis program. A variety of utilities including registration, channel arithmetic, virtual H&E staining and more. Extension programs can be run as standalone software without the need for the imaris software.",2023,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7854018,https://github.com/niaid/imaris_extensions,Python,Apache-2.0,10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9
CytoMAP,"This program is meant to make advanced data analytic techniques accessible for Histo-Cytometry data. The goal is to take established analytical techniques, such as neural network based clustering algorithms, and package them in a user friendly way, allowing researchers to use them to explore complex datasets.",2020,https://gitlab.com/gernerlab/cytomap,https://gitlab.com/gernerlab/cytomap,MATLAB,MIT,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107523
SPACE,"SPACE is an R package for spatial analysis of multiplex images of biological tissues, although spatial data from any context can be used. For many ensembles (i.e. combinations) of spatial elements (e.g. cell types, biomolecules, etc.), SPACE quantifies non-random patterning in a single specimen (called ""cisMI"") or divergent patterning across groups of specimens (called ""transMI""). Thanks to the information-theoretic underpinnings of SPACE, these patterns can be arbitrarily complex: simple co-assortment and mutual exclusion are detected, along with quantitative gradients, structural orientations, context-dependent interactions of 3+ elements, etc. Further tools allow in-depth characterization and visualization of specific ensembles.",2024,https://github.com/eschrom/SPACE,https://github.com/eschrom/SPACE,R,Apache-2.0,10.1101/2023.12.08.570837;10.1073/pnas.2412146122
