SITK-IBEX,"<p>Software for aligning/registering images acquired with the IBEX microscopy imaging technique. This Python package enables alignment of multiple cycles of fluorescence images, acquired using IBEX. A repeated marker is used to register all panels to a selected panel (in the registration nomenclature this is the fixed image). After registration all panels are resampled onto the fixed image.</p><p>While this method was developed for a specific imaging protocol, it will likely work for other  protocols that contain a repeated marker. The registration approach is implemented using the <a href=""https://www.simpleitk.org"">SimpleITK</a> toolkit registration framework.</p><p>The key implementation aspects include:</p><ol><li>Multi-phase based approach with robust initialization.</li><li>Multi-resolution and point sampling.</li><li>Affine transformation model.</li><li>Use of correlation as optimized similarity metric.</li></ol>",2020,https://pypi.org/project/sitkibex/,https://github.com/niaid/sitk-ibex,Python,Apache-2.0,10.1073/pnas.2018488117
SimpleITK Imaris extensions,"<a href=""https://www.simpleitk.org"">SimpleITK</a> based extensions for the imaris (Oxford Instruments) microscopy image analysis program. A variety of utilities including registration, channel arithmetic, virtual H&E staining and more. Extension programs can be run as standalone software without the need for the imaris software.",2023,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7854018,https://github.com/niaid/imaris_extensions,Python,Apache-2.0,10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9
CytoMAP,"This program is meant to make advanced data analytic techniques accessible for Histo-Cytometry data. The goal is to take established analytical techniques, such as neural network based clustering algorithms, and package them in a user friendly way, allowing researchers to use them to explore complex datasets.",2020,https://gitlab.com/gernerlab/cytomap,https://gitlab.com/gernerlab/cytomap,MATLAB,MIT,10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107523
