Term,Definition
Clearing-enhanced 3D (Ce3D),"Tissue clearing method that allows volumetric imaging of thick tissue sections (>200 microns to 3 mm) using direct immunolabeling with fluorescently conjugated antibodies [[Li et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0156-4), [Li et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708981114)]."
Ce3D-IBEX,"Multiplexed 3D imaging method that combines Ce3D and IBEX for visualization of up to 15 markers in a single tissue section using conventional fluorophores and commercially available instruments. The method is currently under development and led by Dr. Hiroshi Ichise, Armando Javier Arroyo-Mejias, and colleagues in the Germain laboratory at the NIH [[Arroyo-Mejias et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.208.Supp.116.23), [Germain et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.13052)]."
Cell DIVE,The Cell DIVE multiplexed imaging solution is an integrated system for imaging 60+ biomarkers from one tissue sample at the single-cell level. The tissue-preserving staining and dye inactivation workflow and advanced image processing enables a more comprehensive understanding of the tissue microenvironment than has been available with traditional chromogenic or fluorescence-based imaging [[Gerdes et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300136110)].
Cell DIVE-IBEX,"Method employing the IBEX dye inactivation protocol with compatible fluorophores on the Cell DIVE platform. This method allows imaging of thin, 2D (5-10 micron) tissue sections."
Conjugate,"Fluorescent dye,  enzyme, or hapten covalently attached to a primary or secondary antibody that is used for downstream detection of the antibody bound to its target in/on a cell."
Detergent,"Reagent included in blocking, staining, and wash buffers to reduce non-specific labeling, enhance reagent spreading, and permeabilize cells for nuclear labels. Examples include saponin, Tween-20, and Triton-X-100."
Fixed Frozen,"Method of tissue preservation where samples are placed in fixative (e.g., formalin), cryoprotected with sucrose, frozen in molds with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) media, and then stored at -80C. The 1:4 Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixed Frozen method refers to the protocol outlined in the original IBEX manuscripts [[Radtke et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117), [Radtke et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9)]."
Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE),Most common form of tissue preservation where tissues are saturated with formalin and then embedded in a block of paraffin wax. Samples are stored at room temperature.
Fresh Frozen (FF),"Method of tissue preservation where samples are frozen at ultralow temperature without fixative (fresh), immobilized in cryosafe media (e.g., OCT, carboxymethyl cellulose), and stored at -80C."
IBEX2D Manual,"IBEX configuration that relies on manual immunolabeling and dye inactivation as initially described in [[Radtke et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117)] and detailed further in Box 2 of [[Radtke et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9)]. This method uses thin, 2D (5-30 micron) tissue sections. The resulting image can be either a single plane or a small volume."
IBEX2D Automated,"IBEX configuration that uses a fluidics device to deliver antibodies and dye inactivation solution directly to the sample with minimal user intervention. This method uses thin, 2D (5-10 micron) tissue sections and was described in a detailed protocol [[Radtke et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9)]. The resulting image is a single plane."
Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX),"An open source, community supported  iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method for high-content imaging of diverse tissues [[Radtke et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117), [Radtke et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9)]."
Multiplexed 2D Imaging,"Standard, single cycle (non-iterative) imaging method applied to thin, 2D (5-30 micron) tissue sections. Prior to inclusion in an IBEX imaging panel, all antibodies are first validated using this method. Most antibodies that are recommended for Multiplexed 2D Imaging are compatible with IBEX if conjugated to a LiBH4-sensitive dye. Antibodies that are not recommended for this method are not suitable for IBEX imaging. The resulting image can be either a single plane or a small volume."
Opal-plex,Method that utilizes signal amplification with Opal dyes and the IBEX dye inactivation protocol to perform multiplexed imaging in heavily fixed tissues and/or detect low abundance epitopes in conventionally fixed tissues. This method was developed by Dr. Emily Speranza and colleagues in the Germain laboratory at the NIH [[Radtke et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2018488117)].
