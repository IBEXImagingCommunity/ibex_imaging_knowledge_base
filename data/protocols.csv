IBEX: an iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method for high-content imaging of diverse tissues,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9,"High-content imaging is needed to catalog the variety of cellular phenotypes and multicellular ecosystems present in metazoan tissues. We recently developed iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX), an iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method that enables multiplexed imaging (>65 parameters) in diverse tissues, including human organs relevant for international consortia efforts. IBEX is compatible with >250 commercially available antibodies and 16 unique fluorophores, and can be easily adopted to different imaging platforms using slides and nonproprietary imaging chambers. The overall protocol consists of iterative cycles of antibody labeling, imaging and chemical bleaching that can be completed at relatively low cost in 2-5 d by biologists with basic laboratory skills. To support widespread adoption, we provide extensive details on tissue processing, curated lists of validated antibodies and tissue-specific panels for multiplex imaging. Furthermore, instructions are included on how to automate the method using competitively priced instruments and reagents. Finally, we present a software solution for image alignment that can be executed by individuals without programming experience using open-source software and freeware. In summary, IBEX is a noncommercial method that can be readily implemented by academic laboratories and scaled to achieve high-content mapping of diverse tissues in support of a Human Reference Atlas or other such applications."
EdU Immunohistochemistry using Click-it reaction,https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.81wgbyoy1vpk/v1,"This protocol allows users to image histology tissue using basic immunohistochemistry techniques in combination with EdU capture (using the Click-it reaction system). EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) will capture S-phase cells with the thymidine analogue, allowing to take a snap-shot of actively diving cells. In this assay the modified thymidine analogue EdU is efficiently incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and fluorescently labeled with a bright, photostable Alexa Fluor dye in a fast, highly-specific click reaction. This fluorescent labeling of proliferating cells is accurate and compatible with antibody methods due to the mild click protocol."
Self-made chrome alum gelatin coated slides,https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.3byl49kkogo5/v1,This is a step-wise protocol for making chrome alum gelatin adhesive and coating microscopy slides for better tissue adherence. This protocol is useful for researchers who are unable to purchase Chrome Alum-Gelatin Adhesive (Newcomer Supply catalog #1033A) in their country.
Comparison of Multiple Snap Freezing Protocols and Description of Optimal Workflow,https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.81wgbz6yogpk/v1,"The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the optimal snap (flash) freezing method for multiplexed tissue imaging. We detail four different methods (see sample preparation) for preparing snap (flash) frozen tissues. We additionally compare the image quality, ease of use, and safety of each method to our preferred method of tissue preservation (fixed frozen with sucrose cryopreservation). To directly compare tissue preservation methods, tissues were collected from one mouse and divided among the five groups. We determined that the optimal protocol for snap frozen tissues is cryogenic freezing with the Seal'N Freeze Box followed by post-fixation of sections using 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. This method was easy to do, froze the tissue quickly without tissue artifacts, and allowed for immunolabeling of antibodies after fixation."
A novel ex vivo approach for investigating profibrotic macrophage polarization using murine precision-cut lung slices,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2024.151038,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive scarring of the lung tissue and declining respiratory function. Given its short prognosis and limited treatment options, novel strategies to investigate emerging experimental treatments are urgently needed. Macrophages, as the most abundant immune cell in the lung, have key implications in wound healing and lung fibrosis. However, they are highly plastic and adaptive to their surrounding microenvironment, and thus to maximize translation of research to lung disease, there is a need to study macrophages in multifaceted, complex systems that are representative of the lung. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) are living tissue preparations derived from the lung that are cultured ex vivo, which bypass the need for artificial recapitulation of the lung milieu and architecture. Macrophage programming studies are traditionally conducted using isolated cells in vitro, thus our objective was to establish and validate a moderate-throughput, biologically-translational, viable model to study profibrotic polarization of pulmonary-resident macrophages using murine PCLS. To achieve this, we used a polarization cocktail (PC), consisting of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-6, over a 72-h time course. We first demonstrated no adverse effects of the PC on PCLS viability and architecture. Next, we showed that multiple markers of macrophage profibrotic polarization, including Arginase-1, CD206, YM1, and CCL17 were induced in PCLS following PC treatment. Through tissue microarray-based histological assessments, we directly visualized and quantified Arginase-1 and CD206 staining in PCLS in a moderate-throughput manner. We further delineated phenotype of polarized macrophages, and using high-plex immunolabelling with the Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX) method, showed that the PC effects both interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Substantiating the profibrotic properties of the system, we also showed expression of extracellular matrix components and fibrotic markers in stimulated PCLS. Finally, we demonstrated that clodronate treatment diminishes the PC effects on profibrotic macrophage readouts. Overall, our findings support a suitable complex model for studying ex vivo profibrotic macrophage programming in the lung, with future capacity for investigating experimental therapeutic candidates and disease mechanisms in pulmonary fibrosis."
