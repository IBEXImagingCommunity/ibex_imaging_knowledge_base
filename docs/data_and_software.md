# Data and Software

<!-- Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from the data_and_software.md.in, datasets.csv and software.csv files. -->

This page lists publicly available datasets acquired using the IBEX imaging protocol and software that was specifically developed for processing and analyzing multiplex imaging. Lists are in reverse chronological order of data/software availability.

If you find the data or software useful in your work, please cite it. We encourage citation of data and software independent of a publication when possible (when they have their own DOI). This enables the community to separate between the utility of a dataset or software from the utility of the scientific work in which it was originally acquired or created.

In humans, this process starts in early fetal development and is highly active until thymic involution in adolescence. To map the micro-anatomical underpinnings of this process in pre- and early postnatal stages, we established a novel quantitative morphological framework for the thymus, the Cortico-Medullary Axis, and used it to perform a spatially resolved analysis. By applying this framework to a curated multimodal single-cell atlas, spatial transcriptomics, and high-resolution multiplex imaging data, we demonstrate establishment of the lobular cytokine network, canonical thymocyte trajectories and thymic epithelial cell distributions within the first trimester of fetal development. We pinpoint tissue niches of thymic epithelial cell progenitors and distinct subtypes associated with Hassall's corpuscles and uncover divergence in the timing of medullary entry between CD4 vs. CD8 T cell lineages. These findings provide a basis for a detailed understanding of T lymphocyte development and are complemented with a holistic toolkit for cross-platform imaging data analysis, annotation, and Organ Axis construction (TissueTag), which can be applied to any tissue.</p></p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This Python package enables alignment of multiple cycles of fluorescence images, acquired using IBEX. A repeated marker is used to register all panels to a selected panel (in the registration nomenclature this is the fixed image). After registration all panels are resampled onto the fixed image.</p><p>While this method was developed for a specific imaging protocol, it will likely work for other  protocols that contain a repeated marker. The registration approach is implemented using the <a href="https://www.simpleitk.org">SimpleITK</a> toolkit registration framework.</p><p>The key implementation aspects include:</p><ol><li>Multi-phase based approach with robust initialization.</li><li>Multi-resolution and point sampling.</li><li>Affine transformation model.</li><li>Use of correlation as optimized similarity metric.</li></ol></p></details>{:/} |
