A picture is worth a thousand words, so how much is a video worth?

As part of our commitment to excellence we encourage knowledge sharing in the form of videos. These include both general talks on multiplexed imaging and short, subject specific, tutorials. The former provide the bigger picture, the state of the field at a particular point in time. The latter provide the finer details associated with a specific task and are a way to formalize and document lab lore (undocumented common practices that are assumed to be common knowledge but are not practiced in the same manner across labs).

| Accelerating discovery together: Community resources for multiplexed imaging of diverse tissues [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFaOPIOcBCE)]. | {::nomarkdown}<details ><summary>Multiplexed antibody-based imaging...</summary><p>Multiplexed antibody-based imaging enables the characterization of cellular interactions, spatial relationships, and histological patterns in tissues. These techniques require considerable resources and domain expertise for implementation, limiting their widespread adoption. To overcome these challenges, we developed Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), an open-source method that can be completed at relatively low cost in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. In addition to cost-effective techniques such as IBEX, community initiatives are needed to extend the reach of multiplexed tissue imaging. The IBEX Imaging Community is an international group of scientists committed to sharing knowledge related to multiplexed imaging in a transparent and collaborative manner. Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs) are community-validated resources that save time and money, increase reproducibility, and support the construction of a Human Reference Atlas. This webinar will provide guidelines for the successful application of IBEX to a wide range of scientific questions using diverse imaging platforms. A significant amount of time will be devoted to the following topics: optimal tissue processing, working with fixed frozen and FFPE specimens, identifying appropriate reagents, and constructing organ atlases. Team science initiatives will be highlighted to encourage attendees to join and accelerate discovery together.</p></details>{:/} |
