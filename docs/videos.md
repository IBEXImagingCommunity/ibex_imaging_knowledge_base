A picture is worth a thousand words, so how much is a video worth?

As part of our commitment to excellence we encourage knowledge sharing in the form of videos. These include both general talks on multiplexed imaging and short, subject specific, tutorials. The former provide the bigger picture, the state of the field at a particular point in time. The latter provide the finer details associated with a specific task and are a way to formalize and document lab lore (undocumented common practices that are assumed to be common knowledge but are not practiced in the same manner across labs).

In the webinar, Dr. Radtke describes two communities working to reduce the time, cost, and expertise required to adopt multiplexed antibody-based imaging approaches. The first resource is the IBEX Knowledge-Base, an open, global repository for reagents, protocols, datasets, and software related to IBEX and other spatial biology methods. Here, Dr. Radtke reviews the design, motivation, and utility of the IBEX Knowledge-Base and associated community.

| Accelerating discovery together: Community resources for multiplexed imaging of diverse tissues [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFaOPIOcBCE)]. | {::nomarkdown}<details ><summary>Multiplexed antibody-based imaging...</summary><p>Multiplexed antibody-based imaging enables the characterization of cellular interactions, spatial relationships, and histological patterns in tissues. These techniques require considerable resources and domain expertise for implementation, limiting their widespread adoption. To overcome these challenges, we developed Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), an open-source method that can be completed at relatively low cost in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. In addition to cost-effective techniques such as IBEX, community initiatives are needed to extend the reach of multiplexed tissue imaging. The IBEX Imaging Community is an international group of scientists committed to sharing knowledge related to multiplexed imaging in a transparent and collaborative manner. Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs) are community-validated resources that save time and money, increase reproducibility, and support the construction of a Human Reference Atlas. This webinar will provide guidelines for the successful application of IBEX to a wide range of scientific questions using diverse imaging platforms. A significant amount of time will be devoted to the following topics: optimal tissue processing, working with fixed frozen and FFPE specimens, identifying appropriate reagents, and constructing organ atlases. Team science initiatives will be highlighted to encourage attendees to join and accelerate discovery together.</p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Highly Multiplexed Imaging of Diverse Tissues Using IBEX [[video](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/6313499546113799179?source=FF4)].           | {::nomarkdown}<details ><summary>Multiplexed antibody-based imaging...</summary><p>Multiplexed antibody-based imaging empowers the study of complex cellular phenotypes in situ by enabling the evaluation of dozens of protein biomarkers in a single tissue section. Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), is an antibody-based staining and chemical bleaching technique that allows comprehensive profiling (65+ parameters) in diverse tissues. It is compatible with 250+ commercially available antibodies and 16 unique fluorophores. It can be adopted by different imaging platforms at a low cost, and the experiment can be done in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. In this webinar, we will go over methods to study normal and malignant lymph nodes and topics related to multiplexed tissue imaging, namely: optimal tissue processing, working with fixed frozen and FFPE specimens, overcoming autofluorescence, identifying appropriate reagents, validating antibodies, and creating organ mapping antibody panels (OMAPs).</p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Ideally coverslip will have fallen off naturally. If coverslip is loose but still attached, gently lift a corner of the coverslip with a pair of fine forceps or razor blade.</p><p>We typically wait until coverslip detaches from slide naturally or, at minimum, is moving freely on the slide under the force of gravity.

Pass the solution through a 0.22 &mu;m syringe filter (Millipore Sigma, cat no. SLGSM33SS) attached to a 20 mL syringe (EXEL Int., cat no. 26280) to remove any impurities prior to use (not shown).</p><p>Always prepare LiBH<sub>4</sub> solution in a chemical fume hood with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Mixing LiBH<sub>4</sub> with diH<sub>2</sub>O will generate hydrogen gas which is highly flammable. For this reason, we always work with small amounts of LiBH<sub>4</sub> relative to the amount of water initially added. We do not mix >10 mg of LiBH<sub>4</sub> with diH<sub>2</sub>O. This amount can be quickly diluted to 1 mg/mL with volumes handled by standard serological pipets/pipet-aids. Always wrap LiBH<sub>4</sub> stock with parafilm (suggest Bemis Company Inc., cat no. S37440) and store in the presence of desiccant. We recommend replacing LiBH<sub>4</sub> every 4 weeks as repeated exposure to moisture/air has been observed to reduce fluorophore inactivation efficacy. Be sure to follow institutional guidelines for proper disposal of hazardous chemicals.</p><p>The formation of bubbles indicates the solution is ready for filtration and subsequent use. For best results, use solution immediately after filtration. We have noted effective fluorophore inactivation up to 4 hours after initial dissolution of LiBH<sub>4</sub>.</p></p></details>{:/} |

Spread evenly using the edge of a cover slip or a separate glass slide via the blood smear technique. Note, it may require multiple spreading passages with the slide to ensure even coating of chrome alum-gelatin without streaks. If chrome alum-gelatin pools on the slide, aspirate excess fluid and respread as these accumulations can result in autofluorescence artifacts during image acquisition. Be mindful of stated expiration date on chrome alum-gelatin.</p><p>For best results, prepare chrome alum-gelatin coated slides freshly (i.e., the day of tissue sectioning) or no more than 7 days prior to tissue sectioning.
