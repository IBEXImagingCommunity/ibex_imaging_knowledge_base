# Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX) Knowledge-Base

The IBEX Knowledge Base is a global, community-driven resource designed to support researchers working with IBEX and related multiplexed imaging methods. Built on principles of open science, reproducibility, and shared ownership, it offers practical tools and expert insights to help scientists overcome the challenges of multiplexed antibody-based imaging.

## What You’ll Find

This evolving platform includes:
* [Discussion forum](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/discussions) for sharing experiences and refining best practices
* [Reagent resources](reagent_resources.md) for finding recommended and not recommended antibodies, conjugation kits, and more
* [Fluorescent probes](fluorescent_probes.md) tested by the community
* [Protocols](protocols.md) covering hardware setup, sample prep, imaging parameters, and computational analysis
* [Videos](videos.md) featuring general talks on multiplexed imaging and focused tutorials
* [Data and Software](data_and_software.md) for accessing publicly available datasets hosted on external repositories and tools developed for multiplexed imaging analysis
* [Publications](publications.md) for exploring peer-reviewed articles and preprints showcasing IBEX applications and technical developments
* [Questions and Answers](q_and_a.md) for addressing aspects of the Knowledge Base, IBEX methods, and software not fully clarified in publications

## How to Use It

Start exploring at the IBEX Imaging Community website. Use the “Reagent Resources” tab to filter antibodies by species, tissue type, and antigen retrieval conditions. For deeper engagement, visit the GitHub repository to access source data, contribute updates, or join the conversation.

In addition to the functionality directly provided on this website we encourage you to use it as context for your AI agent of choice. That is, provide the website URL as context to the AI agent and start a conversation (using URLs for context is not supported by some free chatbot versions). Ask questions about the information available on the site and ask the agent to perform related tasks. A sample interaction, from August 2025, [is documented here](github_copilot_claude_sonnet4_chat_history_august_2025.md).

## Download

There are two easy ways to download the knowledge-base contents to your local computer:
1. Authoritative and versioned forms of the knowledge-base are available for download from the [knowledge-base dataset archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7693278) on Zenodo.
1. The latest, non-authoritative version, which is what you are currently reading, is available for download from GitHub as a [zip file](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Once you have a local copy of the knowledge-base the primary directories of interest are `data` and `docs\supporting_material`. The key elements of interest are the comma separated value (csv) files found in the `data` directory and the image and detailed guidance files found in the  `supporting_material` sub-directories.

Note that the supporting material raw [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (md) files can be read by any text editor. For a more pleasant reading experience use an editor that provides a rendering preview (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) supports [markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview)).

## How to Cite it

When referring to the IBEX knowledge-base in general, please cite either of the following manuscripts and the Zenodo concept level Digital Object Identifier (DOI), [10.5281/zenodo.7693278](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7693278):

* "The IBEX Imaging Knowledge-Base: A Community Resource Enabling Adoption and Development of Immunofluoresence Imaging Methods", doi: [10.7554/eLife.105737.1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.105737.1).
* "The IBEX Knowledge-Base: A central resource for multiplexed imaging techniques", doi: [10.1371/journal.pbio.3003070](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003070).

To enable others to reproduce your work, please cite the specific knowledge-base version level DOI used in your work. For example, [10.5281/zenodo.13122300](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13122300) refers to the knowledge-base version v0.2.0 and [10.5281/zenodo.14645972](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14645972) refers to version v0.3.0.

**Contributors**

Open science is obviously something you support and practice. Don't forget to highlight this in your biosketch or c.v. If using the NIH biosketch format, we recommend listing the knowledge-base under the "Contributions to Science" section.  If using a generic c.v. format, we recommend listing the knowledge-base under a "Datasets" section.

The current knowledge-base usage statistics are available on its [Zenodo page](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7693278).

## Built by the Community, for the Community

Every contributor is recognized with authorship on Zenodo releases, and both successes and failures are documented to accelerate learning. The Knowledge Base supports over 50 unique tissue combinations and continues to grow through global collaboration. Whether you're new to IBEX or refining advanced workflows, this resource is here to help and welcomes your contributions. We operate by 5 guiding principles and a code of conduct.


## Guiding Principles

### <span style="color:purple"> Shared ownership </span>
We are better together! Everyone who contributes to the knowledge-base is acknowledged by name in the Zenodo dataset releases (see [how to contribute](contrib.md) for details). The IBEX Imaging Community conducts discourse in a civil manner and encourages members of the community to share their scientific findings without fear of retribution. The knowledge-base was made possible by researchers like you, see [who they are](the_who.md) and our thoughts on overcoming the fear of sharing. Have a question that needs an answer? Engage with the IBEX Imaging Community on the GitHub [discussion forum](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/discussions).

### <span style="color:purple"> Failure teaches success </span>
Unlike publications, in which only successful work is described, the goal of this knowledge-base is to document both successful and failed work. By sharing failures, we advance science at a faster pace, reduce financial costs, and instill confidence in the resulting data. If you are not sure why things are not working as expected, ask for help on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/discussions).

### <span style="color:purple"> Stewardship and democratization </span>
Our practice of sharing recommended and not recommended reagents prevents other researchers from wasting time and effort on work that is known to fail. The significant material cost of validating antibodies and developing imaging panels is well-described [[Hickey et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01316-y)]. By stewarding our time and resources, we make science more equitable, allowing investigators around the world to prioritize community-validated reagents for their work.

### <span style="color:purple"> Commitment to excellence </span>
As scientists we strive to enable others to reproduce our work, confirming or refuting our results, thus making science self-correcting. Self-correction does not happen by default; it requires an explicit effort on our part [[Ioannidis 2012](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691612464056)]. We are committed to reporting details that are critical for the success of a reagent, e.g., antigen retrieval conditions, detergent in blocking buffer, best conjugates/formats, and alternative clones, if applicable. We, therefore, include information related to antibody validation such as positive and negative controls and other relevant details in the notes section of the supporting materials files, as illustrated [here](./supporting_material/CD21_PE/0000-0003-4379-8967.md). If possible, please additionally include details about the targeted epitope, antibody affinity/avidity, and any image correction methods used. For more details on reagent validation, please [read on](reagent_validation_details.md).


### <span style="color:purple"> Power of iteration </span>
This repository contains the *current state of knowledge* with respect to the IBEX imaging method and associated protocols. The authoritative and versioned knowledge-base is available on Zenodo. This knowledge-base, like the method, is iterative. Help advance and refine this community resource by:

1. Asking a question on the [discussion forum](https://github.com/IBEXImagingCommunity/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/discussions).
1. Adding a publication related to a deposited reagent, dataset, protocol, software or hardware to the list of [publications](https://IBEXImagingCommunity.github.io/ibex_imaging_knowledge_base/publications.html).
1. Confirming previous results or contributing new ones (see [how to contribute](contrib.md)).

## Code of conduct

All members of the IBEX Imaging Community are expected to abide by the [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.html).
