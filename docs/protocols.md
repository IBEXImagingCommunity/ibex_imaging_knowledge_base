# Protocols

<!-- Do NOT edit this file. It is automatically generated from the protocols.md.in and protocols.csv files. -->

As part of our commitment to excellence we strive to make research easily reproducible. We encourage the publication of detailed protocols covering all aspects of the experimental work including hardware construction, sample preparation, image settings, and computational analysis of the final images. Ideally, all protocols would be hosted on a single platform  (e.g. [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/)).
 
While that is the ideal, in practice we know there are multiple protocol repositories and we do not want to limit your choices. This page serves as a central location, referencing protocols across the various hosting platforms.

Have a protocol that you would like to share? Follow the [how to contribute instructions](contrib.md).

| IBEX: an iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method for high-content imaging of diverse tissues [[detailed protocol](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00644-9)].           | {::nomarkdown}<details ><summary>High-content imaging is...</summary><p>High-content imaging is needed to catalog the variety of cellular phenotypes and multicellular ecosystems present in metazoan tissues. We recently developed iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX), an iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method that enables multiplexed imaging (>65 parameters) in diverse tissues, including human organs relevant for international consortia efforts. IBEX is compatible with >250 commercially available antibodies and 16 unique fluorophores, and can be easily adopted to different imaging platforms using slides and nonproprietary imaging chambers. The overall protocol consists of iterative cycles of antibody labeling, imaging and chemical bleaching that can be completed at relatively low cost in 2-5 d by biologists with basic laboratory skills. To support widespread adoption, we provide extensive details on tissue processing, curated lists of validated antibodies and tissue-specific panels for multiplex imaging. Furthermore, instructions are included on how to automate the method using competitively priced instruments and reagents. Finally, we present a software solution for image alignment that can be executed by individuals without programming experience using open-source software and freeware. In summary, IBEX is a noncommercial method that can be readily implemented by academic laboratories and scaled to achieve high-content mapping of diverse tissues in support of a Human Reference Atlas or other such applications.</p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) will capture S-phase cells with the thymidine analogue, allowing to take a snap-shot of actively diving cells. In this assay the modified thymidine analogue EdU is efficiently incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and fluorescently labeled with a bright, photostable Alexa Fluor dye in a fast, highly-specific click reaction.

We detail four different methods (see sample preparation) for preparing snap (flash) frozen tissues. We additionally compare the image quality, ease of use, and safety of each method to our preferred method of tissue preservation (fixed frozen with sucrose cryopreservation). To directly compare tissue preservation methods, tissues were collected from one mouse and divided among the five groups. We determined that the optimal protocol for snap frozen tissues is cryogenic freezing with the Seal'N Freeze Box followed by post-fixation of sections using 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature. This method was easy to do, froze the tissue quickly without tissue artifacts, and allowed for immunolabeling of antibodies after fixation.</p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| A novel ex vivo approach for investigating profibrotic macrophage polarization using murine precision-cut lung slices [[detailed protocol](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2024.151038)]. | {::nomarkdown}<details ><summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis...</summary><p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive scarring of the lung tissue and declining respiratory function. Given its short prognosis and limited treatment options, novel strategies to investigate emerging experimental treatments are urgently needed. Macrophages, as the most abundant immune cell in the lung, have key implications in wound healing and lung fibrosis. However, they are highly plastic and adaptive to their surrounding microenvironment, and thus to maximize translation of research to lung disease, there is a need to study macrophages in multifaceted, complex systems that are representative of the lung. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) are living tissue preparations derived from the lung that are cultured ex vivo, which bypass the need for artificial recapitulation of the lung milieu and architecture. Macrophage programming studies are traditionally conducted using isolated cells in vitro, thus our objective was to establish and validate a moderate-throughput, biologically-translational, viable model to study profibrotic polarization of pulmonary-resident macrophages using murine PCLS. To achieve this, we used a polarization cocktail (PC), consisting of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-6, over a 72-h time course. We first demonstrated no adverse effects of the PC on PCLS viability and architecture. Next, we showed that multiple markers of macrophage profibrotic polarization, including Arginase-1, CD206, YM1, and CCL17 were induced in PCLS following PC treatment. Through tissue microarray-based histological assessments, we directly visualized and quantified Arginase-1 and CD206 staining in PCLS in a moderate-throughput manner. We further delineated phenotype of polarized macrophages, and using high-plex immunolabelling with the Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX) method, showed that the PC effects both interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Substantiating the profibrotic properties of the system, we also showed expression of extracellular matrix components and fibrotic markers in stimulated PCLS. Finally, we demonstrated that clodronate treatment diminishes the PC effects on profibrotic macrophage readouts. Overall, our findings support a suitable complex model for studying ex vivo profibrotic macrophage programming in the lung, with future capacity for investigating experimental therapeutic candidates and disease mechanisms in pulmonary fibrosis.</p></details>{:/} |
| Three-Dimensional Imaging of Tumor-Bearing Tissue Using the Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity Approach [[detailed protocol](https://doi.org/10.3791/67869)].                      | {::nomarkdown}<details ><summary>The spatial heterogeneity...</summary><p>The spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical determinant of therapeutic response, particularly for immune-oncology agents, where success depends on the distribution of specific immune cell subpopulations. This protocol outlines the procurement of human tumor tissue, the mounting of samples on custom-printed platforms, and staining procedures for post-fixation samples. The Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity technique was adapted to characterize the three-dimensional TME with up to 15 markers for tumor, immune, and stromal cells using commercially available antibodies. Imaging depths of up to 100 µm were achieved using an inverted white-light laser confocal microscope with a custom-printed imaging adaptor and commercial glass-bottom dishes to ensure optimal tissue orientation.</p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Though NTM-induced pulmonary disease often presents with bronchiectasis, lung nodules, and cavitary disease, the host response associated with these distinct pulmonary injury patterns has not been well characterized in situ. We sought to evaluate mechanisms of NTM-induced pathology by performing deep phenotypic analysis of immune cell populations in lung tissue from individuals with NTM disease in comparison to a gold standard of granulomatous inflammation, tuberculous (TB) lung disease.</p><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung blocks from patients with either disseminated NTM, pulmonary NTM, or pulmonary TB disease were sectioned and stained following a modified version of the Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX) imaging method. Optimization of the IBEX method was first required to address the significant endogenous fluorescence of lung sections due to the high density of collagen, elastin, and erythrocytes native to pulmonary tissue that is worsened by FFPE preservation and the age of the FFPE blocks.</p><p>In this protocol, we detail a photoirradiation protocol and modified antigen retrieval method that reduces the autofluorescence of clinically archived samples. Furthermore, we provide guidance on antibody panel design, including common challenges such as cross-reactivity, epitope loss following photoirradiation, spectral overlap between adjacent fluorophores, and low signal-to-noise for certain targets. To facilitate efficient imaging of whole lung tissue sections, slides were imaged with a widefield microscope and postprocessed with open-source software to improve image quality. Together, this workflow addresses a critical need by documenting how to obtain highly multiplexed, high-resolution, whole-slide images from challenging samples using widely available instrumentation and reagents. Beyond quantitative imaging of clinical samples, these techniques can be applied to diverse sample types to overcome both endogenous and exogenous sources of fluorescence.</p></p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Despite its growing adoption for generating highly multiplexed immunostaining, implementing IBEX in an automated fashion through deployment in core facilities offers numerous benefits, including increased throughput, reproducibility, and overall efficiency of laboratory staff. Here, we demonstrate the successful application of IBEX on two broadly utilized autostainer platforms and discuss important optimization considerations for panel design using TSA-based reactions for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. This includes the methodology for testing antibody-antigen retrieval sensitivity, an important consideration for IBEX panel design when determining the sequence of antibody development. Additionally, we showcase downstream imaging approaches utilizing commercially available whole-slide scanners and illustrate quality alignment and analysis using commercially available cell phenotyping software. Through detailed descriptions of these methodologies and accompanying videos, we aim to highlight the versatility and ease of IBEX, offering practical guidance for core pathology facilities to integrate IBEX into their existing automated staining platforms.</p></details>{:/}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
